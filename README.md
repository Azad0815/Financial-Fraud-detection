# Financial Fraud Detection Project

## Overview
Financial fraud is a critical issue affecting businesses and individuals worldwide. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based fraud detection system that can identify fraudulent financial transactions with high accuracy.

## Objectives
- Detect fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques.
- Implement various feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
- Evaluate different classification algorithms to determine the best-performing model.
- Provide insights through data visualization and reporting.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains financial transaction records, including both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The key features include:
- **Transaction Amount**: The value of the transaction.
- **Transaction Time**: Timestamp of the transaction.
- **Sender & Receiver Details**: Information about the parties involved in the transaction.
- **Transaction Type**: Different types of financial transactions.
- **Fraud Label**: Indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
  - XGBoost, LightGBM (Advanced ML Models)
  - Flask (Web Deployment, if applicable)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling and transformation
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identifying patterns in fraudulent transactions
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualizing transaction distributions
   
3. **Model Selection & Training**:
   - Implementing baseline models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
   - Evaluating model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   
4. **Deployment (Optional)**:
   - Building a simple API using Flask for real-time fraud detection
   - Deploying on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure/GCP

## Performance Metrics
To evaluate the fraud detection model, the following metrics will be used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC Score
